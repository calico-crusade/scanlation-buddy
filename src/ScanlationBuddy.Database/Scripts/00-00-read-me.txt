This directory houses scripts used to create / migrate the SQLite database.
These are run each time the application performs the first SQL action.

The reason for the prefixes is that all of the scripts are run in alphabetical order, 
so if one script relies on another script being run before it 
(example: Needing a table created before creating an FK constraint)
then that ording is handled via the run order.

Each file should only house 1 script at a time.

This is also used to migrate between different versions of the application,
so keep that in mind when writing scripts. You should be able to "replay"
the scripts at any time and it should NOT break the database.


Honestly, I should use a proper ORM for this, but EF is absolutely awful and
I don't feel like writing one from scratch. This is copied out of another project
that works pretty well, so it's decently robost and gets the job done.


The idea behind the file name prefixes is this:

<Order><Type>-<Order>-<Name>.sql

The first <Order> is the order in which the groups of scripts should be run.
The <Type> is the type of script (See below for mapping).
The second <Order> is the order in which the scripts within a group should be run.
The <Name> is an arbitary name so you know what the script does.

Type list:

0T = Table Create Scripts

9M = Data Migration Scripts
